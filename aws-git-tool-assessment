GIT (Global Information System)

Git is an open source version control system which helps in maintaining multiple versions and collaborate with different teams while
developing the application.

Git Statges

1. Working directory (where we write our code)
2. Staging area (where we track the changes to check the revisions we made to the working files)
3. repository (which contains the history of the changes in the project files)



git merge vs git rebases

merge -> shows all the changed or added files
rebase -> will not show

mere -> saves the history of changes
rebases -> overrides the history
